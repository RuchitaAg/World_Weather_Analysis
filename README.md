# World_Weather_Analysis

## Objectives:

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. A few changes have been recommended to take the app to the next level. 
These updates are as follows:

1. Adding the weather description to the weather data retrieved. 
2. Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
3. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary and using the Google Maps Directions API, we'll create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.



## Results:

For the purpose of this analysis I shortlisted cities with Max temp. between 55F and 85F. This resulted in 400+ locations across the globe based on first returned Hotel Name. They were plotted on a map with suggested markers. The output is as can be seen below:

From there 4 cities in North California were picked up for making a travel itinerary with San Ramon as the start and end city. The itinerary map is as follows:

The details of city name, country, hotel and weather have been shown as pop up markers in below chart:

The locations seem to be in proximity and can be covered in a 2-3 nights stay. The weather looks moderate and the places are picturesque.

Hope this is useful!
